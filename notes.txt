- Test symlink -- I believe it will work but only when built as an executable i.e., when installed from pip
  - Is argv[0] is the symbolic link (YES)

- Don't modify token names as it there could be a situation like: Data and data (lexer find with case sensitive tokens)
- Symbol table
- importing modules, warning user about dependencies
